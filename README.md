### Haskell example:
A simple fractal image renderer
===============================

I've always been intrigued by fractals, and decided to make an example program
in [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org) that renders a part of the
[Mandelbrot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) set to an image.

The code is based on Michael Bradshaw's [Mandelbrot](http://mjb.io/+/haskell-mandelbrot)
blog post, tweaked it for brevity and educational purposes.  Finally I sharpened
the contrast a bit.  To find a nice contrast enhancing curve I used the awesome
curve fitter of [zunzun.com](http://zunzun.com).

The idea is that it can show some of Haskell's features in a short program
with a wonderfully complex output.  Hopefully it is more suitable for introducing
Haskell to newcomers then the fibonacci sequence and the quicksort algorithm.

[Posting this project to Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/2d2zia/haskell_example_a_simple_fractal_image_renderer)
resulted in some adjustments to the code, please find the details in the comments.


## Output

A fairly large rendering (10000 x 14142) is commited to this repository in PNG
format. Have a [look](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cies/haskell-fractal/master/w10000_i1200.png)
(17MB, sorry Github).


## PDF version

This code comes with a [PDF version](https://github.com/cies/haskell-fractal/blob/master/poster.pdf?raw=true)
of the fractal rendering combined with the Haskell source code used to create it.


## Usage

On a recent Haskell setup the following commands should be enough to build and
run the code from a cabal sandbox:

    cabal sandbox init
    cabal install
    ./.cabal-sandbox/bin/haskell-fractal

To make test renderings a `width` of `2000` should be enough, for a final rendering
the `width` may be increased to something like `10000`.

Finally [ShareLatex](http://sharelatex.com) chimed in to compile the PDF.

## Typeclasses changes

We made some changes to this code to produce a color image for use on our web site. We wrote [an extensive analysis](https://typeclasses.com/art/mandelbrot) of this program and the changes we made.
